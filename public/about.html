<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've always found coding interesting, so wanted to try a course at Udemy.
  I plan on learning how to build websites, and later to learn how to create mobile apps</p>

<p>I like to dip my finger in a lot of pies, I've got a BSc in Film Prodution Technology, 
  I used to work as a makeup artist, Jeweller, QA analyst and most recently a kitchen and bedroom designer
  after completing a dimploma in interior design with the Interior Design Institute.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoying working out at the gym, taking part in Pole classes, playing Sims, 
  watching the latest cinema releases and making clay and silver trinkets / jewllery.</p>
